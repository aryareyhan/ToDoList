# To do List

This to-do list app, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is my first coding project independent of any assignment. It offers a simple and intuitive interface for managing daily tasks, allowing users to add, edit, and delete items. This project demonstrates foundational web development skills and marks the beginning of my coding journey.
